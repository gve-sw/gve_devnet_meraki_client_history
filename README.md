#### Environment Variables Setup
For ease of configuration and better security, this application uses a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following entries:
```env
MERAKI_API_KEY=your_meraki_api_key
EXCEL=True
TIMESPAN_IN_SECONDS=desired_timespan_for_reports
LOGGER_LEVEL=CRITICAL
```
* Note, if no value is set for timespan in .env, it will default to 1 day. 
* Optionally, set LOGGER_LEVEL: Warning, Info, Critical, Debug, etc.

## Installation/Configuration
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/gve/gve_devnet_meraki_client_history.git`
2. Set up a Python virtual environment. Make sure Python 3 is installed in your environment, and if not, you may download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python 3 is installed in your environment, you can activate the virtual environment with the instructions found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
3. Set up your `.env` file as per the instructions above.
4. Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

### Running Locally
Run the program:
```shell
python app.py
```

### Running with Docker (Containerized)

Ensure Docker is installed and running, then build and run the Docker container as follows:

#### Build
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
```shell
docker build -t meraki_client_history:v1 .
```

#### Run
Run the Docker container from the built image. You can also add flags as required, just like when running the script directly.
```shell
docker run -it --name meraki_client_history_prod -v /your_local_path/for_reports:/app/reports meraki_client_history:v1 [flags]
```
* Replace /your_local_path/for_reports with the path where you want to store your Excel report on local machine. 

Examples of running the containerized app with different flags:
- Without additional flags:
  ```shell
  docker run -it --name meraki_client_history_prod -v /your_local_path/for_reports:/app/reports meraki_client_history:v1
  ```
- With flags:
  ```shell
  docker run -it --name meraki_client_history_prod -v /your_local_path/for_reports:/app/reports meraki_client_history:v1 -o wireless --raw
  ```

#### Stop and Remove
After the usage, if you want to stop and remove the container, use:
```shell
docker stop meraki_client_history_prod
docker rm meraki_client_history_prod 
```

#### Re-run
If you need to re-run the script with different flags, ensure you stop and remove the existing container as described above, and then issue the `docker run` command again with new flags.

### Flags

- `-o, --option` (Required): Specify the product type. Available options:
    - `all`: For all products.
    - `wired`: For wired products.
    - `wireless`: For wireless products.

- `--raw`: (Optional) If present, export all raw data.

## Examples of Use
```shell
python app.py -o [option] [--raw]
```

1. To generate a filtered report for wired and wireless clients:

```shell
python app.py
```
or
```shell
python app.py -o all
```

2. To generate a report specifically for wireless clients with filtered data:
```shell
python app.py -o wireless
```

3. To generate a report specifically for wired clients with filtered data:
```shell
python app.py -o wired
```

5. To generate a report for wireless and wired clients with filtered data:
```shell
python app.py -o wireless
```

6. To generate a report with raw data from API call, use the "--raw" flag.
```shell
python app.py -o wireless --raw
```

Note: If the user has access to multiple Meraki organizations, a list of available orgs will be displayed, and the user prompted enter
