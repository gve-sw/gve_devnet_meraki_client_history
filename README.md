> Note: You can add your account as Full Organization Admin to your organizations by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions).

### Environment Variables Setup
For ease of configuration and better security, this application uses a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following entries:
```env
MERAKI_API_KEY=your_meraki_api_key
EXCEL=True
TIMESPAN_IN_SECONDS=desired_timespan_for_reports
LOGGER_LEVEL=CRITICAL
```
* Note, if no value is set for timespan in .env, it will default to 1 day. 
* Optionally, set LOGGER_LEVEL: Warning, Info, Critical, Debug, etc.

## Installation/Configuration
### With Docker
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/gve/gve_devnet_meraki_client_history.git`.
2. Set up your `.env` file as per the instructions above.

**Note:** If you haven't installed Docker or Docker Compose, you will need to do so. Follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get started.

### Optional: Running Locally Without Docker
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/gve/gve_devnet_meraki_client_history.git`.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment. Make sure Python 3 is installed in your environment, and if not, you may download Python [here](URL_to_download_Python). Once Python 3 is installed in your environment, you can activate the virtual environment with the instructions found [here](URL_to_virtual_environment_instructions).
3. Set up your `.env` file as per the instructions above.
4. Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Flags

- `-o, --option` (Required): Specify the product type. Available options:
    - `all`: For all products.
    - `wired`: For wired products.
    - `wireless`: For wireless products.

- `--raw`: (Optional) If present, export all raw data.

## Usage
### Running with Docker (Containerized)
Once installation and configuration is complete, run the application using Docker Compose as follows:
```shell
docker-compose run meraki_client_history [flags]
```
Replace `[flags]` with any of the flags described below.

#### Examples of running the containerized app with different flags:
1. To generate a filtered report for wired clients:
```shell
docker-compose run meraki_client_history -o wired
```
2. To generate a filtered report for wireless clients:
```shell
docker-compose run meraki_client_history -o wireless
``` 
3. To generate a filtered report for wired and wireless clients:
```shell
docker-compose run meraki_client_history -o all 
```
4. To generate a filtered report for wired and wireless clients with unfiltered API response data:
```shell
docker-compose run meraki_client_history -o all --raw
```


### Running Locally
Once installation and configuration is complete, if you chose to use your local installation of python (instead of container), run the application using:

```shell
python app.py -o [flags]
```

1. To generate a filtered report for wired and wireless clients:
```shell
python app.py -o all
```
2. To generate a report specifically for wireless clients with filtered data:
```shell
python app.py -o wireless
```
3. To generate a report specifically for wired clients with filtered data:
```shell
python app.py -o wired
```
4. To generate a report with raw data from API call, use the "--raw" flag.
```shell
python app.py -o wireless --raw
```

Note: If the user has access to multiple Meraki organizations, a list of available orgs will be displayed, and the user prompted enter
